# Behavioral Economics Capstone Project

We worked with the Minnesota Wild and New York
Islanders to increase season ticket renewals.

We created an experimental survey where we modified
the teams' email communications to season ticket 
holders containing information about their ticket 
benefits.

We then tracked participants memory retention of
the benefits along with their likelihood to renew 
their season tickets.

Our dataset contains memory retention, renewal 
likelihood, and demographic information across over 
400 individuals.

The data and R markdown file are posted in their
respective folders.

# Experimental Design

**Industry Partners**

Minnesota Wild & New York Islanders (NHL Teams)

**Research Objective**

Using a behaviorally-informed approach, increase season ticket renewals.

**Behavioral Approach**

*Issue*

The emails sent out to season ticket holders are do not clearly convey the message that they should renew their tickets and the benefits are displayed sloppily in a matrix.

*Solution*

Modify the email format to concisely highlight the main message that season ticket holders should renew their tickets and to better showcase the benefits.

**Control**

Current Minnesota Wild email communications to season ticket holders.

**Treatments**

All treatments have the same concise messaging regarding season ticket renewals. The differences are how we design the benefits matrix.

1. Ranking: Organize the benefits by their rankings according to subjects' preferences.

2. Categorization: Create buckets relating the benefits (e.g., fan experience, merchandise, etc.) while maintaning the ranking system within each bucket.

3. Reduced List: Display the 5 highest ranked benefits in a matrix.
