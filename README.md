# Behavioral Economics Capstone Project

We worked with the Minnesota Wild and New York
Islanders to increase season ticket renewals.

We designed an experimental survey where we modified
the teams' email communications to season ticket 
holders containing information about their ticket 
benefits.

We then tracked participants memory retention of
the benefits along with their likelihood to renew 
their season tickets.

Lastly, we conducted robust ANOVA tests and designed 
linear regression models to test for treatment effects.

Our dataset contains memory retention, renewal 
likelihood, and demographic information across over 
400 individuals.
